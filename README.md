## Windows 7 and 8 UI using JavaScript and CSS
Intensive plain JavaScript has been written to create Web app which looks like windows 7 or 8 of 2011-12. It was my fun project to learn JavaScript and use it for complex cases of web App. It might help you to explore different use-case of JavaScript and how we can control CSS from JavaScript.
